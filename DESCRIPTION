Description: This package contains code to run Time-to-Event, Space-to-Event, and 
    Instantaneous Sampling methods to estimate abundance of unmarked animals.
    It includes functions to create encounter histories for each of these methods 
    from a camera database. To make an encounter history, it currently requires:
    1) a camera database with the following columns: cam (unique ID for the camera; any class), 
    datetime (class POSIXct), and count (the number of the study species seen in each picture; class numeric)
    2) a dataframe with two columns: cam (unique ID for the camera; any class) 
    and a (area of the camera, class numeric).
    Disclaimer! This package is currently in development and probably buggy.
