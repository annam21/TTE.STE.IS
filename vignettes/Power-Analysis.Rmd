Workflow for running a simulation-based power analysis for STE, TTE, and IS

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(spaceNtime)
```

# STE power analysis 

The precision in STE is driven by a combination of number of cameras, number of occasions, and animal density. 

To simulate STE under different scenarios, use the function `ste_pwr_sim()`.

```{r}
rslt <- ste_pwr_sim(
  N = c(1, 2),
  study_area = c(1e6),
  ncam = c(30, 50),
  nocc = c(1000, 2000),
  cam_area = 100,
  niter = 5
)
rslt
```

To visualize the results, you can plot the iterations with 
```{r}
plot_pwr_sim(rslt)
```

You can also visualize the coefficient of variation with 
```{r}
plot_pwr_cv(rslt)
```
